#looks like no classification was found, try another sequence next time
#however, there is a output file created, could it be that it's classified as a precursor peptide (the entire sequence as a whole)
#maybe try to multiple short sequences? 

#23 May
try with a short sequence from the training set
python classify.py -m cnn-linear -w /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/weights/cnn_linear.hdf5 -outdir /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/out_dir/23_05_22 -outname ripps_cnn_linear_train_pos_1st_seq --keep_negatives -i /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/data/test_fa_from_all_positives.fa
#successfully classified as positive

try a mixture
python classify.py -m cnn-linear -w /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/weights/cnn_linear.hdf5 -outdir /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/out_dir/23_05_22 -outname ripps_cnn_linear_train_pos-negs_space --keep_negatives -i /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/data/seq_from_training_and_space.fa

#use a different architecture 
python classify.py -m cnn-parallel -w /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/weights/cnn_parallel.hdf5 -outdir /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/out_dir/23_05_22 -outname ripps_cnn_parallel_train_pos-negs_space --keep_negatives -i /rds/general/user/ytt16/home/NeuRiPP/data/seq_from_training_and_space.fa

Results: both architecture successfully classify positive as positive but both space sequences are classified as negative (higher score in parallel architecture)
